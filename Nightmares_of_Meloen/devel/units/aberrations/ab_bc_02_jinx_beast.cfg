    description=_ "Fate can be treacherous at times, as quick to offer you a present as to turn it into a burden. When Meloen succeeded in brushing the knowlegde of magic's origin with the tip of her mind during a short lap of supreme lucidity, she fused with her environment, against all odds. But her first doubts opened the door to more self-doubt and she started to think that luck only was responsible for these events, and not her determination and work. Or rather, she thought that misfortune played with her life, amusing itself in putting her in a nightmare.
Black cats are simple forest creatures that have turned into a hideous chimera by Meloen's thoughts and, although no one knows what kind of magic is behind their power, it seems that any creature that cross their evil eyes is stroke by misfortune."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_ARCANE}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
