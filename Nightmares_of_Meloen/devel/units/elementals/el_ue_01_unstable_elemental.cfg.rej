Panarbori, the spirit of nature originally made to flesh by the power of Meloen's love toward the forest, had been also altered by the doubts of Meloen. He became the opposite of what the former silver mage was seeking in her companion, and instead of being considerate and a source of stability, he went impulsive and violent. His fits of anger would be compared to the wrath of nature itself and were responsible for a few natural catastrophes.
 
-These unstable elementals are bits of Panarbori that get released after a rage tantrum, with the help of Meloen's power. They are as unpredictable as their father, rushing like small furies from a battlefield to another."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_TERRAIN_LINK}
