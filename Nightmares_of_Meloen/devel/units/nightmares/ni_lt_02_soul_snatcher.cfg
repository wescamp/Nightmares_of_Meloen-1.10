    description= _ "King Dowrein I, Memoirs of a mercenary:
'I had seen this scene a hundred times, the quiet walk of the merchants, the soldiers narrating their exploit of the day before, then the anxiety of the horses, the stop of the march and all eyes and hears looking for the smallest sign. And the attack of those demonic creatures.

But as used as we were to drive them back to that cursed forest, that fear remained the same each with each battle. The fear to lose our mind and soul to one of them, and ultimately, our life.'"+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DRAIN}
