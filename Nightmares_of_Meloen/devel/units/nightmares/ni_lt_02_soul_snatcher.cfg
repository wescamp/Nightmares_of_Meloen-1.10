    description= _ "In her moments of happiness, Meloen enjoyed gazing at butterflies. In these rare moments of meditation she also got conscious of how much they were short lived and realised her own condition of life.
During a sleep, while she was pregnant, Meloen saw a spooky spirit shaped like a butterfly, floating above her and the child she was holding, and immediately identified the spirit as an underling of death itself, warning her that she wouldn't live long enough to see her child growth. There was little time then, before spectres of death spread into the forest."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DRAIN}
