_ "General strategy against Nightmares of Meloen" + "

" + _ "The Nightmares of Meloen faction is chaotic, except for the neutral <i>Creepers</i> and <i>Unstable Elemental</i>. It is composed of quite fast units with many specials or abilities. For this reason, you have to follow the day/night cycle strictly if you command a lawful faction. They can hit very hard at night but on the other hand they have several units with low resistance or low defense. This means that, depending on the units you recruited, you should be able to counter-attack with good results at favorable time of the day." + "

" + _ "The Nightmares of Meloen don't have particularly efficient units to hold villages. Taking into account the high price of some of their units (<i>Life Thief</i>, <i>Howling Darkness</i>), you can try to win through economical dominance. When advancing and retreating, capture their villages earlier and stay on yours for longer, denying them the gold to buy their expensive units. They have some cheap units too, but depending on which faction you play, these sometimes lack the  capability to efficiently hurt you." + "

" + _ "<u>Unhatched:</u> as this unit will charge to inflict maximum damage, you should screen your ranged-oriented units so it can't reach them. To do so you might rely on different units according to its trait as each trait give it some resistance bonus for some damage type. Should it attack, having your units arranged so that the <i>Unhatched</i> can only reach your melee fighters will most likely mean heavy retaliation damage for it. Get ready to finish them off on your turn whenever possible." + "

" + _ "<u>Black Cat:</u> with its magical attack and the jinx special, the <i>Black Cat</i> is one of the first units you may want to kill if you are not Undead. It benefits from high defense but her rather poor resistances help with killing her in a minimum of strikes when your best time of the day has come. After it has hit you, <i>Unhatched</i>, <i>Life Thief</i> or <i>Scornful Watchers</i> will most likely follow to inflict heavy damage." + "

" + _ "<u>Life Thief:</u> Arcane melee with draining. Thanks to those pesky <i>Ghosts</i>, we all know  that units of this kind are not easy to handle. <i>Life Thieves</i> will likely be seen in all match-ups save the Loyalists one. Fight them with ranged fire or arcane, slow them or run away from them. As their defense and their physical resistances are lower than the <i>Ghost</i>'s, countering them with any range unit is good enough to deal with the extra hitpoints it steals. Even the usage of blade or pierce melee can be acceptable from good defense, if you fight on an advantageous time of day." + "

" + _ "<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> its ranged attack turns arcane resistance into weakness. For this reason, it will be Loyalists worst enemy and will also be seen in numbers against Knalgans and Northerners. Slow and weak, Nightmares will have to cover it with their tanks. Your ability to win will often be measured by how well you can clear the way for attacking the watcher." + "

" + _ "<u>Howling Darkness:</u> as an expensive unit without melee attack, the <i>Howling Darkness</i> is an ideal target when you are countering, but as it is fast and skirmisher, go for hitting the unit when you have a good chance to kill or it will slip right through your net. It will often be used to support <i>Unhatched</i> and <i>Life Thieves</i> on offense to reduce retaliation and can be a threat itself at night especially against the cold-fearing Drakes." + "

" + _ "<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> this versatile unit can be used as a scout mostly in its tornado form that you can find on plain, road and castle. It will almost never fight in this form and will prefer to move to hill or forest when it is ready to fight. It's often up to you to accept the challenge or not, as it will be much slower in those forms. The <i>Unstable Elemental's</i> most disturbing use is when it moves behind your lines and take a defending form (quake, bramble or possibly whirlpool), cutting your retreat. The slow ranged attack of the bramble form, obviously combines well with <i>Unhatched</i>'s charge at level 1 and berserk at level 2." + "

" + _ "<u>Creepers:</u> if you are not playing a chaotic faction, this unit should not make you change your strategy. You should keep trying to catch units with more hitpoints at your best time of the day, so that you don't waste too much fire power on killing this cheap unit. If you are chaotic though, you may have to adapt in order to cope with those pests that can hit you when you are at your weakest. When attacking <i>Creepers</i> in melee, target the ones with fewer <i>Creepers</i> around so that you reduce the retaliation. When they form a chain, you can consider breaking it in two to double their upkeep." + "
