"Rebels vs Nightmares of Meloen" + "

" + "When Rebels realize they are playing against Nightmares, their first idea will be to get some <i>Woses</i>. While this is a good idea, the best is too wait for dawn or second night to get one, so that Nightmares are at the closest to launch the counter. When you get your <i>Wose</i>, you need to get some <i>Mages</i> quickly. They will make <i>Life Thieves</i> think twice before pushing at the end of the night when your <i>Woses</i> get engaged. At other time of the day, better to keep recruiting Elves, mostly cost efficient <i>Elvish Fighters</i>." + "

" + "On counter, use the <i>Wose</i> first on <i>Unhatched</i> at dawn, backed by <i>Mages</i>, <i>Elvish Shaman</i> staying on good defense to slow any <i>Unhatched</i> or <i>Life Thief</i>, the <i>Elvish Fighters</i> covering up while other units deploy to get ready for the push. When pushing keep the <i>Woses</i> moving full speed while Elves try to slow, zoc in and trap Nightmares. When attacking, use <i>Elvish Fighters</i> on <i>Black Cats</i> and <i>Scornful Watchers</i>, <i>Mages</i> on <i>Life Thieves</i>, <i>Elvish Shamans</i> and <i>Woses</i> on <i>Unhatched</i>." + "

" + "When retreating, have the <i>Woses</i> go full speed while using <i>Elvish Fighters</i> to cover the fleeing <i>Mages</i> and <i>Elvish Shamans</i>. As they will get wounded pretty badly keep on recruiting more to be able to hold until next day. When you can't retreat anymore, use Elves in lines, <i>Elvish Fighters</i> on the most exposed spots and <i>Elvish Archers</i> or <i>Elvish Scouts</i> elsewhere. Keep slowing <i>Unhatched</i> if your healthiest <i>Elvish Shaman</i> can stay on forest with some cover. On defense at night, do not use the <i>Woses</i> to hold the line, but rather leave them behind to regenerate as it will help make the Nightmares' <i>Life Thieves</i> aimless." + "

" + "<u>Elvish Archer:</u> if the <i>Elvish Archer</i> does not make as much damage as the <i>Mage</i> and does not have has much hitpoints as the <i>Elvish Fighter</i> he can still be of some use. It can increase the speed of your army while making significant damage on Nightmares' melee units for free. He can replace an <i>Elvish Scout</i> but can't take the role of an <i>Elvish Fighter</i>. So recruiting one or two is enough." + "

" + "<u>Elvish Fighter:</u> there is obviously no chance for you to win in this matchup if you don't rely on <i>Elvish Fighter</i>'s resilience and punch. He is the guy that will bring down any ranged units of Nightmares, and he will make maximum retaliation on <i>Unhatched</i> or <i>Life Thief</i> before leaving. That is the best hitpoints that money can buy and he will act trustfully as <i>Mage</i>'s or <i>Elvish Shaman</i>'s bodyguard. Have a lot of them, and keep recruiting to make up for the losses you'll have in their ranks." + "

" + "<u>Elvish Scout:</u> on wide maps, it can be good to have some, but most of time, you will get one for village grabbing only. In the middle of the game, you will go for <i>Elvish Fighters</i> and an <i>Elvish Archer</i> once in a while. You will recruit more <i>Elvish Scouts</i> only is you think that you have some chances to level them with the required XP being one kill lower then <i>Elvish Archers</i>'." + "

" + "<u>Elvish Shaman:</u> she is as usual the hidden treasure of the Rebels. With slow special, she is able to reduce the damage Nightmares will inflict at night and nailed down the <i>Life Thieves</i> when they have to retreat. With her high defense on forest, she is quite difficult to take down for the <i>Unhatcheds</i> while they can't really get help from the <i>Black Cat</i> as he would feared to get slowed in front of angry <i>Elvish Fighters</i>. The usual things with shamans : slow the targets you can't kill, or slow a target to lower its retaliation if you intend an attack on your enemy's primary range." + "

" + "<u>Mage:</u> the use of Rebels' <i>Mage</i> will be quite different from Loyalists'. As the presence of <i>Woses</i> will call for <i>Life Thieves</i>, the <i>Mage</i>'s main role will be to put pressure on them and counter when the day comes. For this job, a quick mage is best as he can catch up with running <i>Life Thieves</i>. When targeting them, make sure you hit the ones with most XP as you don't want one to level. He will again be the preferred target for the <i>Unhatched</i> and hence should be covered with <i>Elvish Fighters</i> at night as the <i>Woses</i> will be busy running away from <i>Life Thieves</i>." + "

" + "<u>Merman Hunter:</u> less useful than the Loyalists' <i>Merman Fighter</i>, he still can get some use if a patch of water in present in the map. Try to use them to fix an <i>Unstable Elemental</i> in the water. Don't hesitate to attack him as your resistances are better than his." + "

" + "<u>Wose:</u> you can recruit some <i>Woses</i> as he is excellent at countering the <i>Unhatched</i>'s charges or taking them down at day time. While he is resistant to most Nightmares' attacks, he is very weak when facing the <i>Life Thief</i> who can inflict heavy damage with its arcane melee while getting healed from drains. As the <i>Wose</i> is as expensive and slower then the <i>Life Thieves</i> you can't afford to let him fight them alone and should back him with <i>Mages</i>." + "
