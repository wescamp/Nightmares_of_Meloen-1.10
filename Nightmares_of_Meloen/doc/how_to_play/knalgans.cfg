" + _ "When you get the Knalgan Alliance against Nightmares, you will be in control of the game. Just getting <i>Dwarvish Fighters</i> or <i>Footpads</i> will already be a test of your opponent's skill at playing Nightmares. He will have to combine a very efficient use of his units and some well-thought gamble with <i>Unhatched</i> to stay in the game. If you add some <i>Dwarvish Thunderers</i> and a <i>Dwarvish Ulfserker</i>, even the most seasoned Nightmares' players will have a hard time. " + "

" + _ "<u>Dwarvish Fighter:</u> with their dual blade/impact damage type, the <i>Dwarvish Fighters</i> are the purest anti-<i>Unhatched</i> units in the game, so get enough of them to control the <i>Unhatched</i>. When the time has come for you to attack, they will naturally excel at taking down anything around. Make sure you keep them on good defense however. Even when they have been cursed, they are still probably better off sitting on their favorite terrain with defense lowered to around 50% than running over 30% defense terrain for cover. Hitting back the <i>Black Cat</i> that just cursed them is often the best they can do." + "

" + _ "<u>Dwarvish Guardsman:</u> slow, expensive and with low damage, you can't make enough use of his pierce attack to recruit any of them. As the <i>Dwarvish Fighter</i> makes such a good job at countering the <i>Unhatched</i>, you won't need the <i>Dwarvish Guardsman</i>'s steadfast either." + "

" + _ "<u>Dwarvish Thunderer:</u> with his ranged attack, good resistances and good hitpoints, the <i>Dwarvish Thunderer</i> is a good recruit. He will be useful mainly for staying in control at night when the Nightmares are pushing. Remaining on a mountain, he can stand well against the <i>Unhatched</i> and has a chance to deal massive retaliation to <i>Black Cats</i> or <i>Scornful Watchers</i>. His main offensive role will be to aim at the <i>Life Thieves</i>, which, if numerous enough, will make the <i>Dwarvish Thunderers</i> a necessity." + "

" + _ "<u>Dwarvish Ulfserker:</u> with his guaranteed safe kills on the <i>Howling Darkness</i> and great chances of instantly killing <i>Black Cats</i> or <i>Scornful Watchers</i>, the <i>Ulfserker</i> is obviously a good unit to get. His biggest drawback is he can be drained to death by the <i>Life Thief</i>. In some circumstances the <i>Unhatched</i> can also kill him, so always make sure you can cover him properly before attacking. If there are some <i>Creepers</i> around, remember that a group of four or five (depending on <i>ulf's</i> traits) has a good chance to kill a full-health <i>Ulfserker</i>." + "

" + _ "<u>Footpad:</u> with their two impact attacks they are a very convenient units to have against Nightmares. The <i>Footpad</i> can inflict free hits to the <i>Unhatched</i> with the ranged attack (has a good chance of hitting as the <i>Unhatched's</i> defense is below 50% nearly everywhere), while his/her excellent defense, good hitpoints and impact melee makes it difficult for the <i>Unhatched</i> to deal with him/her when pushing in." + "

" + _ "<u>Gryphon Rider:</u> while the <i>Gryphon Rider</i> is an awesome offensive unit, it might have a hard time when fighting Nightmares. He can easily be trapped by the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> or the <i>Howling Darkness</i>, which could hurt him a lot due to the impact weakness. Even though he dishes out tremendous retaliation to <i>Unhatched</i>'s charge, if the <i>Unhatched</i>'s trait give it a boost to blade resistance (lowering each hit's damage by 5), it will never think twice before charging him taking into account their difference in price (except on daytime). Be prudent when using the <i>Gryphon Rider</i>. While most of the time, he only needs two hits to kill a <i>Black Cat</i>, putting too much hope into getting two hits against a 60+ defense unit might be a bad gamble with <i>Gryphon Rider</i>'s 24 gold." + "

" + _ "<u>Poacher:</u> the <i>Poacher</i> can give your recruitment a different flavor. Best defense on forest, he can exploit this common terrain that Dwarves will avoid. He can supply some hits on the <i>Life thief</i> or retaliation against <i>Black Cats</i> and <i>Scornful Watchers</i> for cheap price. When the <i>Unhatched</i> get more frequent, the <i>Footpad</i> is a better recruit though, since the <i>Poacher</i> is such a juicy target for them." + "

" + _ "<u>Thief:</u> the <i>Thief</i>'s best use is to hit Nightmares when they put themselves on bad defense, not taking much damage in the process. If the <i>Thief</i> can dart around and backstab anything, s/he will probably also make enough damage to prove a good investment. If a <i>Thief</i> gets a kill, s/he won't need much more XP to level, so you might try to feed him some. <i>Thieves</i> have low hitpoints, bad resistance to nearly all of Nightmares' damage and you can't reasonably hope to backstab with several, so there's no need to get too many. A strategy based on <i>Thieves</i> would be quite risky, as they are very quick to fall when attacked by a <i>Black Cat</i> & <i>Unhatched</i> force." + "
