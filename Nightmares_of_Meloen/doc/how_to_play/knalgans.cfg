_ "Knalgan Alliance vs Nightmares of Meloen" + "

" + _ "When you get the Knalgan Alliance against Nightmares, you will be in control of the game. Just recruiting <i>Dwarvish Fighters</i> or <i>Footpads</i> will already be a test of your opponent's skill at playing Nightmares. He will have to combine the most efficient use of his units with some well thought gamble with <i>Unhatched</i> to get a game to play. Add some <i>Dwarvish Thunderers</i> and a <i>Dwarvish Ulfserker</i> even the most seasoned Nightmares' players will have a hard time. " + "

" + _ "<u>Dwarvish Fighter:</u> with their dual blade/impact damage type, the <i>Dwarvish Fighters</i> are the purest anti-<i>Unhatched</i> units in the game, so get enough of them to control the <i>Unhatcheds</i>. When the time has come for you to attack, they will obviously be good at taking down anything around. Just make sure to keep them on good defense, when they have been cursed, they are still probably better sitting on their favorite terrain with a defense lowered to around 50% rather than running on worse terrain for cover. Hitting back the <i>Black Cat</i> who just cursed them is often the best they can do." + "

" + _ "<u>Dwarvish Guardsman:</u> slow, expensive and with low damage, you can't make enough use of his pierce attack to recruit any of them. As the <i>Dwarvish Fighter</i> makes such a good job at countering the <i>Unhatched</i>, you won't need the <i>Dwarvish Guardsman</i>'s steadfast either." + "

" + _ "<u>Dwarvish Thunderer:</u> his ranged attack, his good resistance and good hitpoints, the <i>Dwarvish Thunderer</i> is a good recruit. He will be mainly useful to stay in control at night when the Nightmares are pushing. When staying on mountain, he can stand well against <i>Unhatcheds</i> and has a chance to to massive retaliation on <i>Black Cats</i> or <i>Scornful Watchers</i>. His main offensive role will be to aim at <i>Life Thieves</i>, and if you meet many of these, the <i>Dwarvish Thunderer</i> will become a necessity." + "

" + _ "<u>Dwarvish Ulfserker:</u> with his guaranteed safe kill on the <i>Howling Darkness</i> and great chance to kill <i>Black Cats</i> or <i>Scornful Watchers</i>, the <i>Ulfserker</i> is an obvious good recruit to get. However, he can get drained to death by the <i>Life Thief</i>. In some circumstances the <i>Unhatched</i> can also kill him, so always make sure you can cover him properly before attacking. If there are some <i>Creepers</i> around, remember that a group of four or five (depending on traits) of them has a good chance to kill a full health <i>Ulfserker</i>." + "

" + _ "<u>Footpad:</u> with his double impact attacks he is a very convenient unit to have against Nightmares. The <i>Footpad</i> can attack on range the <i>Unhatched</i> for free hit (he has good chance of hitting once has <i>Unhatched</i>'s defense is below 50% nearly everywhere), while his excellent defense, good hitpoints and impact melee makes it difficult for the <i>Unhatched</i> to handle him when pushing." + "

" + _ "<u>Gryphon Rider:</u> while the <i>Gryphon Rider</i> is an awesome offensive unit, it might have a hard time when fighting Nightmares. He can easily be trapped by the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> or the <i>Howling Darkness</i>, which could potentially hurt him a lot due to his impact weakness. Even if it does tremendous retaliation on <i>Unhatched</i>'s charge, if the <i>Unhatched</i>'s trait give him a boost in blade resistance (lowering each hit's damage by 5 hitpoints), he will never think twice before charging him taking into account their difference in price (except at day time). Be prudent when using the <i>Gryphon Rider</i>, while most of the time, he only needs two hits on a <i>Black Cat</i> for the kill, putting to much hope on two hits on a 60+ defense unit, might be a gamble with <i>Gryphon Rider</i>'s 24 gold." + "

" + _ "<u>Poacher:</u> the <i>Poacher</i> can give to your recruitment a different flavor. Best defense on forest, he can make use of this common terrain that Dwarves will avoid. He can supply some hit on the <i>Life thief</i> and retaliation on <i>Black Cats</i> or <i>Scornful Watchers</i> for cheap price. When the <i>Unhatcheds</i> get more frequent, the <i>Footpad</i> is a better recruit though, since the <i>Poacher</i> is such a juicy target for them." + "

" + _ "<u>Thief:</u> the <i>Thief</i> can be best used to counter Nightmares when they put themselves on bad defense without making much damage. If the <i>Thief</i> can walk around and backstab anything, he will probably be able to make enough damage to make up for his gold. If one <i>Thief</i> got a kill, you might try to feed him with XP to level him. As <i>Thieves</i> have quite low hitpoints and bad resistance on nearly all Nightmares' damage, no need to get several of them as you can't reasonably hope you will get opportunity to backstab with several of them. Counting on a <i>Thief</i> based strategy is quite risky though, because they are very quick to fall under the <i>Black Cat</i>/<i>Unhatched</i> combination." + "
