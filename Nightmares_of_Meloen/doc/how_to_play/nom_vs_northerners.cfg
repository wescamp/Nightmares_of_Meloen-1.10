"Nightmares of Meloen vs Northerners" + "

" + "The fight between these two chaotic factions will be relentless. As Nightmares' units are slightly weaker and more expensive, it will be their turn to decide when to retreat or heal a unit. If they fail to do so and try to match Northerners in an all-out war, it is likely that they will end up critically wounded and undermanned." + "

" + "While the natural way for Nightmares of Meloen to fight Northerners would be to use their abilities to make up for Northerners' number, that strategy doesn't fare very well. Nightmares' best chance is to quickly turn to <i>Creepers</i>. Getting too many <i>Unhatched</i> will make the Northerners spam <i>Whelps</i>. The natural counter for Whelps is the <i>Life Thief</i>. However, if the Nightmares try to match the trolls with an adequate number of <i>Life Thieves</i>, they'll soon find themselves outnumbered - and that's not something they want to happen." + "

" + "<u>Unhatched:</u> this time, basing your army around this unit won't be that safe : the <i>Troll Whelp</i> is usually quite efficient at countering it, charging <i>Grunts</i> is often not a good idea and the fire of <i>Orcish Archers</i> is efficient enough. Though it remains important to keep a few around because they remain great <i>Archer</i> and <i>Wolf</i> killers and if their traits and the <i>Howling Darkness</i> are used skillfully, they can even occasionally charge <i>Grunts</i> or <i>Whelps</i>." + "

" + "<u>Black Cat:</u> it is a vital unit to have to weaken defense of Northerners' melee units. Keep it on the best defense and don't leave Northerners too many spots to attack it as a <i>Grunt</i> only needs two hits to kill a cat at night. Even then, it will be <i>Grunts</i>' primary target, so Nightmares will have to regularly put new <i>Black Cats</i> in their recruit list to make up for the lost ones." + "

" + "<u>Life Thief:</u> while it is a useful unit to face <i>Whelps</i> as it exploits their arcane weakness, its low defense and lack of fire resistance makes it an <i>Orcish Archer</i>'s favorite meal. However, as the other northerner troops will hardly deal with your <i>Life Thief</i> on their own, recruiting it will force your opponent to invest in <i>Orcish Archers</i>, a unit that is more expensive and an easy prey for your <i>Unhatched</i>. Still, it is more a unit to get in the middle of the game after Nightmares survived the orcs' first assaults and the Northerners move to an attrition warfare with <i>Whelps</i>." + "

" + "<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> the only unit good at attacking <i>Grunts</i> by itself, it deals good damage without retaliation. However, as it still requires 6 or 7 hits to kill a <i>Grunt</i>, the support of <i>Black Cats</i> is necessary to inflict enough damage per turn to withstand the influx of <i>Grunt</i> hordes. Its retaliation is also good enough to make cursed melee units think twice before attacking. However, because it is by far not as cost efficient as the <i>Grunts</i> here, they aren't enough to assure your victory, and are only a part of the mix you need." + "

" + "<u>Howling Darkness:</u> it can provide helpful support for melee attackers and its ranged attack is very useful to finish off cursed <i>Grunts</i> or <i>Whelps</i>. But as its outlooks on survival are quite bleak against the melee-heavy Northerners, getting one at a time is enough. As it gets a nice health point boost on leveling, Nightmares might want to feed it with kills (a bit more than three kills are needed)." + "

" + "<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> this scout can find some room to fit in. It can be useful on the water against <i>Nagas</i> and can hold a hill or mountain for a while. The bramble form on forest, while it gets a nice slow special, is weak to <i>Grunt</i>'s blade. While the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> is very mutable, something is common to all forms: they can be poisoned." + "

" + "<u>Creeper:</u> its lack of mobility is not a problem as both factions are chaotic, while their relatively high defense requires on average two <i>Grunts</i> to kill one at full health. They do a pretty lousy job at holding village against more than 2 units. <i>Creepers</i>' priority is to bring down the <i>Orcish Archers</i> and cover healing units and <i>Watchers</i>. As they are of neutral alignment, make them attack at daytime when they will receive less retaliation. While they can be used to attack <i>Wolf Riders</i>, they should remain defensive against the other melee units. Keep the full health <i>Creepers</i> in front to maximize retaliation before they die. Try to manage your gold to recruit them in packs of at least three as their power comes with number." + "

" + "<u>Summary:</u>" + "
" + "Use Creepers on Orcish Archers and Black Cats with Scornful Watchers on Grunts. The Unhatched can at times be used to charge but you have to create good conditions for that. If you really have to charge something, try to use the Floating Darkness to limit retaliation (unless you target an Archer), and keep in mind the egg's traits. Charging Assassin is a good idea to get rid of the poison that turns your Unhatched into a joke. If you face an army of Trolls get some Life Thieves. If you can't, it's best to just ignore Trolls unless you have a bunch of idle Creepers. Don't pay as much attention to high defense terrain (except for the Cat) as to units' reachability when moving." + "
