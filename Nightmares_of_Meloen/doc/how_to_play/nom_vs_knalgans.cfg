" + _ "A general purpose recruit will be good against Knalgans, all of the units you have here can serve a purpose in this match-up. Even the arcane resistance of their units doesn't make the <i>Life Thief</i> useless, as it remains a good counter against the <i>Ulfserker</i>, and can tank a bit on flatland where you don't want to expose your other units, especially against those harassing <i>Footpads</i>." + "

" + _ "<u>Unhatched:</u> they will have a tough job dealing with the <i>Dwarf Fighter</i> or the <i>Footpad</i> because of their impact attacks. Still, the Knalgans will have to shift to other units, like the <i>Thunderer</i>, the <i>Poacher</i>, or the <i>Thief</i>, if they want to bring your <i>Life Thieves</i> down. Those units are fit to be charged, so keep a few <i>Unhatched</i> units around." + "

" + _ "<u>Black Cat:</u> you will need these against Knalgans. They'll do a great job at diminishing the survivability of the elusive units, and will help to negate the dwarves' incredible defense in mountains. They are an easy prey for the <i>Ulfserker</i> though, and you'll probably have to accept losing a few of them during the battle. So keep a regular flux of recruiting to always have 1 or 2 of them in the field." + "

" + _ "<u>Life Thief:</u> a bit like the Undeads' <i>Ghost</i>, this unit will help with countering the ulf, and defend against <i>Fighters</i> and <i>Footpads</i>. However, they aren't a cost efficient damage dealer here, so don't recruit too many as they'll lower your fire-power with each of them." + "

" + _ "<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> like against the loyalists, the <i>Watcher</i> will get a bonus in damage against every unit you'll face, making it a precious and cost efficient ranged damage dealer. Having too many will make their protection difficult against the <i>Ulfserkers</i>, but having several around to attack the melee oriented units, especially the cursed ones, is an excellent approach." + "

" + _ "<u>Howling Darkness:</u> their ability is appreciable, but not a necessity. Because it is an expensive unit, and an extra safe kill for the <i>Ulfserker</i>, you might prefer to spend the money on more <i>Watchers</i> or <i>Unhatched</i> to outmatch the Knalgans in numbers or power." + "

" + _ "<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> you will want one of these for the scouting role mainly : grabbing villages and gathering intelligence. Don't forget that other forms can occasionally be useful, for tanking and slowing to lower retaliation." + "

" + _ "<u>Creeper:</u> if the game goes for a stalemate you might want to accumulate these instead of banking. They can also be tiresome defenders to remove for the knalgans if they want to push at day. But generally speaking, you will prefer to use other units when you face the Knalgans, as a few <i>Fighters</i> in mountains will hold massive amounts of <i>Creepers</i>." + "

" + _ "Once you see your opponent is Knalgan, you'll want to diversify your army a bit and recruit more <i>Watchers</i> than you usually have, so get a <i>Watcher</i> as soon as possible if you don't have one already, and do the same for the <i>Life Thief</i>." + "

" + _ "Each time it is safe, you'll want to use your <i>Black Cat</i> on <i>Gryphons</i>, <i>Thieves</i>, <i>Footpads</i> and <i>Fighters</i> to negate their massive defense and make them easy targets for your <i>Watchers</i> and at times your <i>Life Thieves</i> and <i>Unhatched</i>. Use those last two to charge the <i>Thunderers</i> and <i>Poachers</i> who can remain a threat to your <i>Life Thieves</i>. If you see massive amounts of <i>Footpads</i>, get a few more <i>Life Thieves</i> and slowly progress with a line of them at the front and your <i>Black Cats</i> and <i>Scornful Watchers</i> following." + "
