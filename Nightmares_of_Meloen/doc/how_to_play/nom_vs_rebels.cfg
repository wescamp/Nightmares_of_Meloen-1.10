" + "The <i>Unhatched</i> and <i>Black Cat</i> combination will shine in this match-up. The defense debuffing will negate the specialty of the nimble elves, and the massive damage of the <i>Unhatched</i> will be especially devastating given their relatively low hitpoints. This won't be enough to dominate the field though : the cost efficient fighter can still deal some nasty retaliation even if your <i>Unhatched</i> has the appropriate trait, and the <i>Wose</i> is almost invincible against it. Therefore, you'll also need a mix of support units." + "

" + "Your opponent will probably try to hold your night push, capitalize experience by finishing off the units that took hard retaliation and wait to have regrouped a few <i>Woses</i> before attacking you at day. Try to seize the dynamic of the game in your favor with an early threat and have the push'n pull happen around his villages rather than yours. If he brings in too many <i>Woses</i>, counter-recruit with <i>Life Thieves</i>, and use the support of a <i>Howling Darkness</i> if too many fighters block the way." + "

" + "<u>Unhatched:</u> They'll be your core troop here, dealing massive damage to the elves who are on bad terrain or under the effect of jinx, as well as shielding other units from swords and arrows. Unless you see a <i>Wose</i> spam, you should keep them in high numbers." + "

" + "<u>Black Cat:</u> Another of your key units in this match. They won't deal much damage, but they'll have a massive impact on the organization of Rebels' defense. Always have at least one, but you may recruit several as they'll be really busy, cursing every unit around." + "

" + "<u>Life Thief:</u> Their arcane damage will make them quite decent damage dealers against most of the Rebels' troops. While they really shine when dealing with the <i>Woses</i>, they aren't as cost efficient as the <i>Unhatched</i> for the other jobs. So recruit according to the number of <i>Woses</i> you face." + "

" + "<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> Because nearly all units it will fight with are weak to arcane, the <i>Scornful Watcher</i>'s attack won't be as strong. Still, the rounding of damage make it do a 7-3 ranged attack (at night only) making it a passable archer-like creature. It may deal with the human mage too - in favorable conditions. You can have one around, but restrain from having more as your money is probably better spent elsewhere." + "

" + "<u>Howling Darkness:</u> If you face packs of elves to counter your <i>Unhatched</i> army, its horror ability will prove very helpful by reducing retaliation. Moreover, its skirmishing capability will make it well able to ZoC units, get to an extra hex to attack from, or even slip behind the lines to threaten villages, decoy, divide open spaces and disorganize the Rebels' defense organization in general. It is quite an expensive unit though, so don't recruit several of them." + "

" + "<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> The <i>Elemental</i> will have a vital role of scouting and gathering intelligence. It will also be able to tank in hills at times, or grab the forest hexes your that opponent would want. Finally, when coming out of a forest, its slowing special will ensure your <i>Unhatched</i> take low retaliation even against the fighters. The unit isn't too damage/cost efficient though, so bear in mind that you decrease your fire power with each of them." + "

" + "<u>Creeper:</u> Again, the <i>Creepers</i> will offer an alternative for your army, but they don't win a game on their own, especially since the <i>Wose</i> is next to invincible when facing them. Go the <i>Creeper</i> way if you fight many elves who aren't willing to come for a fight." + "
