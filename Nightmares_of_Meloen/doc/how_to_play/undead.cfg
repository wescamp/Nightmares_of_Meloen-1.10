"Undead vs Nightmares of Meloen" + "

" + "Having to fight Nightmares is one to the toughest experience for Undead. Unlike what they are used to, Undead in this matchup will play by counter-attack as the ability of make the most damages is not on their side. While you will be relatively safe on the ranged front, the <i>Unhatched</i>'s impact will break your <i>Skeletons</i> in piece, the <i>Life Thief</i>'s arcane will tear them apart while the cheap <i>Creepers</i>' banding is an additional threat to your <i>Dark Adepts</i>. So you will have to turn on the survival mode as soon as possible, recruiting <i>Ghoul</i>, <i>Ghost</i>, <i>Walking Corpse</i>, still some <i>Skeletons</i> and <i>Dark Adept</i> for the counter." + "

" + "Always keep a decent amount of <i>Dark Adepts</i> on the board in order to keep Nightmares under pressure of a possible attack and the threat of a hard counter-strike. This way you will be ruling on the ranged as they will rule on the melee part. As you will unlikely face the threat of <i>Life Thieves</i> in the beginning, you will have to deal with <i>Unhatched</i> first by recruiting <i>Walking Corpses</i> to contain them and keeping your <i>Skeletons</i> on high defense. While your <i>Walking Corpses</i> begin taming the <i>Unhatched</i>, Nightmares will send more <i>Life Thieves</i>. Try to make them attack your <i>Skeletons</i> as if they get wounded, they will become an easy job for your <i>Dark Adepts</i>. " + "

" + "It is quite sure that at a certain moment, as your <i>Walking Corpses</i> starts getting annoying, Nightmares will recruit <i>Creepers</i>. As level 0 units, they are quite a natural opposition for the <i>Walking Corpses</i>, however they require some special techniques to deal with them. <i>Creepers</i> have a neutral alignment so you better fight them at night as two hits will be enough to kill them (they won't get plagued). Because the banding ability can make them inflict high damage you should always try to attack the most isolated ones, if you really need to kill one in the pack, better use the <i>Skeleton</i> as he resists strongly their pierce." + "

" + "<u>Dark Adept:</u> again, the <i>Dark Adept</i> will be your best unit for attacking. The threat of the <i>Unhatched</i>'s charge will be the major challenge, as three hits are enough to kill an adept at night. When they are in position to attack they should hit the <i>Unhatched</i> first as they will do maximum damage against them. The second best choice being the <i>Life Thief</i>. Try to pick your target so your <i>Dark Adept</i> can take the shoot from good defense or make sure you can cover him immediately. You'll want to go for a kill each time you attempt to damage an <i>Unhatched</i>, because even a badly hurt one will safely charge your <i>Dark Adept</i> for massive damage before dying." + "

" + "<u>Ghost:</u> with drains on its arcane melee, the <i>Ghost</i> can enjoy this matchup. It is simply unattackable by the <i>Unhatched</i> without very heavy risk, and efficient enough to deal damages to the <i>aberrations</i> and <i>Unstable Elemental</i>and to a lesser extend to the <i>Creepers</i>. Its only problem will be when facing full health <i>Life Thieves</i> or <i>Scornful Watchers</i>. As the <i>Ghost</i> has worst resistance, less hitpoints and doesn't hit as hard, it should not engage in direct fight with them. Hopefully it can rely on its better movement points to make sure to keep far enough, as long as it doesn't get slowed by the bramble form of the <i>Unstable Elemental</i>." + "

" + "<u>Ghoul:</u> don't underestimate the <i>Ghoul</i> role in this matchup. It is a decent candidate for holding village against <i>Unhatcheds</i> with its poison retaliation, and <i>Life Thieves</i> with its relative resistance to arcane. He can also poison <i>Unstable Elemental</i> to force them to heal, depriving Nightmares of support units." + "

" + "<u>Skeleton:</u> it is a good support unit against Nightmares. As it certainly fears the <i>Unhatched</i>'s impact and <i>Life Thief</i>'s arcane melee, he can cause enough damage to make its sacrifice worthwhile. While the <i>Skeleton</i> can help clearing <i>Creepers</i> out of the way, it is not worth putting it on bad defense terrain for that as the Nightmares' counter will hurt him badly. It is also the best damage dealer against <i>Black Cat</i> and <i>Scornful Watcher</i> if they are present on the field. But it is not worth to feed it with kills, better use a <i>Walking Corpse</i> to plague them, or try to upgrade a <i>Ghost</i>." + "

" + "<u>Skeleton Archer:</u> do not recruit any <i>Archer</i>, they are made of the kind of bones <i>Unhatched</i> likes to play with. At any time of the day, the <i>Unhatched</i> will be attracted by them and his impact charge attack will destroy them within the second. There is no way the <i>Skeleton Archer</i> can make enough damage before dying to repay its gold." + "

" + "<u>Vampire Bat:</u> even the hax power of the <i>Bat</i> is not enough to save them against the charge of an <i>Unhatched</i>. Any bat is killed in two hits and the intelligent ones are dead in one single hit at night. If you got one, use it to steal village or disrupt Nightmares' organization. But stay away from <i>Unhatcheds</i> and <i>Scornful Watchers</i> at all time." + "

" + "<u>Walking Corpse:</u> the use of <i>Walking Corpse</i> is mainly for obstructing, screening off <i>Dark Adepts</i> and <i>Skeletons</i> from their foes. You can also place them around units that are holding a position to reduce the number of spots available for attack. On attack, they should focus on <i>Creepers</i> and <i>Unhatched</i>." + "
