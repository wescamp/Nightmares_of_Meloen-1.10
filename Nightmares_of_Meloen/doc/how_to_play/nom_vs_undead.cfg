"Nightmares of Meloen vs Undead" + "

" + "This matchup will be another total war for Nightmares. Facing another chaotic faction, there won't be much time to rest even if the pace of the game might get slower depending on the units recruited." + "

" + "As Nightmares realize they are facing Undead they will most likely have the edge to launch the first attack. As Undead's major tool to contain attack from Nightmares is the <i>Walking Corpse</i> and it's rarely recruited in the beginning of the game, there will be a window for Nightmares to strike first before the Undead get fully prepared. During this period, the <i>Unhatched</i> will rule the place raiding <i>Skeletons</i> and <i>Dark Adepts</i>." + "

" + "As Undead start building up their army of <i>Walking Corpses</i>, Nightmares will have to change their recruitment pattern toward <i>Life Thief</i> and <i>Creepers</i>. The <i>Life Thief</i>, despite its high price, will be an invaluable asset with its heavy arcane melee that hurts any undead. The <i>Creepers</i> will be necessary to match <i>Walking Corpses</i>' numbers." + "

" + "<u>Unhatched:</u> one of Nightmares' most important weapons in this match-up. The <i>Unhatched</i>'s role is to focus on <i>Dark Adepts</i> and bring them down before they inflict deadly strikes. While somewhat depending on its trait, its charge is also very efficient at fighting skeletons despite the heavy retaliation at night. For these reasons, you should keep getting some after <i>Walking Corpses</i> begin to spread. If they have to charge a <i>Walking Corpse</i>, make sure to pick one that can be killed in one hit as the retaliation will hurt plenty." + "

" + "<u>Black Cat:</u> as <i>Black Cat</i>'s special jinx is not affecting Undead, she has a too huge price for its limited power in this matchup and should not be recruited in numbers. If you have got one, use her to hunt <i>Bats</i>, weaken a skeleton with magic before <i>Unhatched</i>'s assault or hold a village." + "

" + "<u>Life Thief:</u> with its arcane melee, the <i>Life Thief</i> will be the master of the battle, the only threat to it being the <i>Dark Adept</i>. While it will be inflicting damage all around, it will have very few opportunities to drain so it will have to retreat to heal. Don't let your bloodlust make you forget it or you could lose all hopes to level." + "

" + "<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> as most Undead's units have some arcane weakness, the <i>Scornful Watcher</i> doesn't play a significant role. The only exception is if Undead recruitment turns for <i>Ghouls</i> against which he is the best weapon. Otherwise, use your <i>Scornful Watcher</i> on <i>Bats</i> and <i>Ghosts</i>, or to defend against the <i>Dark Adept</i>. Getting a <i>Scornful Watcher</i> to deal with <i>Ghosts</i> is a good idea if you can't afford getting a <i>Life Thief</i>." + "

" + "<u>Howling Darkness:</u> its cold ranged attack is very inefficient against most Undead's units and its terror ability doesn't affect undead. For these reasons, refrain yourself from recruiting any <i>Howling Darkness</i>." + "

" + "<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> it is good to have one of these quick units on the board. As the tornado form - the fastest - is quite weak, it will be used mainly for scouting and remote village protection. The bramble form can also be of some help with two impact attacks and the slow special. All form being weak to arcane, it will be a target for the <i>Ghosts</i> that will heal on them with drain when they don't fear getting slowed." + "

" + "<u>Creeper:</u> the <i>Creepers</i> are a good match for the <i>Walking Corpse</i> with the advantage of not fearing to be plagued. They have less health points but hit harder when the banding ability is used well. Make sure you keep them in pack as the <i>Walking Corpses</i> will always target the most isolated ones. You should wait the end of the night to attack them as they will lose their chaotic bonus that allows them to kill your neutral <i>Creeper</i> in two hits. Keep in mind though, when you kill <i>Walking Corpses</i> to clear access to a <i>Dark Adept</i>, that doing it at daytime will bring little benefit as your <i>Unhatched</i> won't hit that hard." + "
