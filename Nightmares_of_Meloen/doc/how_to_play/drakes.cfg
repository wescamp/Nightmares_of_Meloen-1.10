_ "Drakes vs Nightmares of Meloen" + "

" + _ "If both teams were randomly picked, they will most probably be badly prepared for this very offensive match, but so you may, as the saurians you'll have picked early won't be your best weapons. The <i>Life Thief</i>, Nightmares best asset at attack, and the <i>Drake Burner</i>, your own nightmare killer, are both expensive recruits so each side would wait to know their opponent before recruiting them. So if the game is starting at dawn, it is very likely that the first night will be quite peaceful and you will have plenty of time to equip yourself in <i>Burners</i> for the next day." + "

" + _ "<i>Burners</i> and <i>Life Thieves</i> are the best enemies and two of one kind can kill one of the other every turn at their best time of the day. It shows how crucial the dusk will be for your Drakes, so be ready to retreat in time. As you are at least as fast as the <i>Life Thief</i>, if Nightmares has fallen back too much at day, you will have a easy retreat. If he has stayed close to you to prepare counter, retreat using <i>Drake Fighters</i> to cover your <i>Burners</i> from the <i>Unhatcheds</i>. That strategy might fail if Nightmares succeed at trapping you with <i>Howling Darknesses</i>. That is the reason why, using your <i>Drake Fighters</i> on them at day is the second objective you have to meet to keep the match going." + "

" + _ "Depending on the number of <i>Howling Darkness</i> turning to <i>Skirmisher</i> might be a decent alternative. Beside dealing free damage to the <i>Howling Darkness</i> when they are the most impetuous, the <i>Skirmisher</i> have additional benefits: dealing a lot of retaliation to not slippery <i>Unhatched</i>, getting high defense units that might requires Nightmares to get more <i>Black Cats</i>. On top of that, as saurians resist well <i>Life Thief</i>'s arcane, they can force Nightmares to turn to <i>Scornful Watchers</i> that are of not much use against your Drakes." + "

" + _ "<u>Drake Burner:</u> he is <i>Life Thief</i>'s fieriest enemy. As you will definitely see many of them around, getting as much <i>Burners</i> as you can is a safe strategy. As only quick ones are truly faster than the <i>Life Thief</i>, when they can't reach any, they can also have a shot at the <i>Unhatched</i>. As both <i>Burner</i>'s advancement are awesome against Nightmares, you should try to level one." + "

" + _ "<u>Drake Clasher:</u> due to his slowness and his price, the <i>Clasher</i> is not the best buy against Nightmares. You can however decide to get one if Nightmares haven't any <i>Howling Darkness</i> as it can retaliate the <i>Unhatcheds</i> charge with one of his two attacks depending on their trait. When <i>Howling Darknesses</i> are around, their mobility and their cold attack will be devastating to the <i>Clasher</i> with no chance of retaliation. You don't want them to have such easy kills." + "

" + _ "<u>Drake Fighter:</u> the <i>Drake Fighter</i> is necessary to cover <i>Burners</i>' retreat at the end of the day as they will give maximum retaliation to <i>Unhatched</i>'s charge and they are relatively cheap. They should not however try to shield off the <i>Life Thief</i> as they won't be able to survive the whole night. When attacking, the <i>Drake Fighter</i> should focus on the <i>Howling Darkness</i>, the <i>Black Cat</i> or the <i>Unstable Elemental</i>, but don't forget his fire range can cheaply harass the opponent's <i>Life Thieves</i> if you have no better target." + "

" + _ "<u>Drake Glider:</u> faster than the <i>Drake Fighter</i> with better defence and an impact damage type that can scare away the <i>Unhatched</i>, the <i>Drake Glider</i> can be used for holding off the Nightmares when <i>Burners</i> are retreating. During attack at day time, they will be useful mostly for trapping the Nightmares at dawn and prevent them from fleeing too easily. As they are not as efficient as the <i>Drake Fighter</i> at dealing damage to the <i>Howling Darkness</i> the role they can play is still secondary and you should not recruit too many of them." + "

" + _ "<u>Saurian Augur:</u> the <i>Augur</i> with his low hitpoints and cold damage doesn't not play a big role in this matchup. He will have trouble getting away from the <i>Unhatched</i> and Drakes won't have really time to protect him. Because the damages dealt are so heavy, his healing skill is minored in interest. His cold ranged attack should be used on <i>Unhatched</i> or anything else that he can kill. You may take your chance and feed him with kills as at level 2, the <i>Soothsayer</i> will be able to cure <i>Black Cat</i>'s jinx." + "

" + _ "<u>Saurian Skirmisher:</u> Depending on the number of <i>Howling Darkness</i> the <i>Skirmisher</i> might be a good choice for recruitment. Nearly as fast as them, doing free damage on melee, they beat them in price. However, due to Saurians' weakness on both cold and impact, keeping them alive might be a difficult task. Hence it is only possible if <i>Howling Darknesses</i> are enough to guarantee a target before <i>Skirmisher</i> dies." + "
