"Drakes vs Nightmares of Meloen" + "

" + "If both players chose random faction, Nightmares will most likely be ill-prepared for this very deadly match, but so might be you, as the saurians you'll have picked early won't be your best weapons. The <i>Life Thief</i>, Nightmares' best attacker, and the <i>Drake Burner</i>, your own nightmare killer, are both expensive and each side would wait to know their opponent before recruiting them. So if the game started at dawn, it is very likely that the first night will be quite peaceful and you will have plenty of time to equip yourself with <i>Burners</i> for the day." + "

" + "<i>Burners</i> and <i>Life Thieves</i> are each other's nemesis' and two of one kind can kill one of the other every turn at their best time of the day. It shows how crucial the dusk will be for your Drakes, so be ready to retreat in time. As you are at least as fast as the <i>Life Thief</i>, if the Nightmares fall back too far at day, you will have an easy retreat. If they stay close to you to prepare a counter, retreat using <i>Drake Fighters</i> to cover your <i>Burners</i> from the <i>Unhatched</i>. This strategy might fail if Nightmares succeed at trapping you with <i>Howling Darknesses</i>. That is the reason why, using your <i>Drake Fighters</i> on them at day is the second objective you have to meet to keep the match going." + "

" + "Depending on the number of <i>Howling Darkness'</i> turning to <i>Skirmishers</i> might be a decent alternative. Beside dealing free damage to the <i>Howling Darkness</i> when they are the most impetuous, the <i>Skirmisher</i> has additional benefits: it deals a lot of retaliation to not-slippery <i>Unhatched</i>, it's high defense might convince the Nightmares to get more <i>Black Cats</i>. On top of that, as saurians resist <i>Life Thief</i>'s arcane, they can force Nightmares to turn to <i>Scornful Watchers</i> which are of not of much use against your Drakes." + "

" + "<u>Drake Burner:</u> he is <i>Life Thief</i>'s fiercest enemy. As you will definitely see many <i>Life Thieves</i> around, getting as many <i>Burners</i> as you can is a safe strategy. As only quick ones are truly faster than the <i>Life Thief</i>, when they can't reach any, they can also have a shot at the <i>Unhatched</i>. As both <i>Burner</i>'s advancement are awesome against Nightmares, you should try to level one." + "

" + "<u>Drake Clasher:</u> due to his slowness and his price, the <i>Clasher</i> is not the best buy against Nightmares. You can however decide to get one if Nightmares haven't got any <i>Howling Darkness</i> as it can retaliate the <i>Unhatched</i> charge with one of his two attacks depending on their trait. When <i>Howling Darknesses</i> are around, their mobility and their cold attack will be devastating to the <i>Clasher</i> with no chance of retaliation. You don't want them to get such easy kills." + "

" + "<u>Drake Fighter:</u> the <i>Drake Fighter</i> is necessary for covering <i>Burners</i>' retreat at the end of the day as they will deal high retaliation to <i>Unhatched</i>'s charge and they are relatively cheap. They should not however try to shield off the <i>Life Thief</i> as they won't be able to survive the whole night. When attacking, the <i>Drake Fighter</i> should focus on the <i>Howling Darkness</i>, the <i>Black Cat</i> or the <i>Unstable Elemental</i>, but don't forget his fire range can cheaply harass the opponent's <i>Life Thieves</i> if you have no better target." + "

" + "<u>Drake Glider:</u> faster than the <i>Drake Fighter</i> with better defense and an impact damage type that can scare away the <i>Unhatched</i>, the <i>Drake Glider</i> can be used for holding off the Nightmares when <i>Burners</i> are retreating. During attack at day time, they will be useful mostly for trapping the Nightmares at dawn and preventing them from fleeing too easily. As they are not as efficient as the <i>Drake Fighter</i> at dealing damage to the <i>Howling Darkness</i> the role they can play is still secondary and you should not recruit too many of them." + "

" + "<u>Saurian Augur:</u> the <i>Augur</i> with his low hitpoints and cold damage doesn't play a big role in this match-up. He will have trouble getting away from the <i>Unhatched</i> and Drakes won't have really time to protect him. Because the damages dealt are so heavy, his healing skill becomes less practical. His cold ranged attack should be used on <i>Unhatched</i> or anything else he can kill. You may take your chance and feed him with kills as the level 2 <i>Soothsayer</i> will be able to cure <i>Black Cat</i>'s jinx." + "

" + "<u>Saurian Skirmisher:</u> Depending on the number of <i>Howling Darkness'</i>, the <i>Skirmisher</i> might be a good choice for recruitment. He's nearly as fast as them, doing free damage on melee, and beats them in price. However, due to Saurians' weakness to both cold and impact, keeping them alive might be a difficult task. Hence getting him is only advisable if there's enough <i>Howling Darknesses'</i> to guarantee a target before the <i>Skirmisher</i> dies." + "
