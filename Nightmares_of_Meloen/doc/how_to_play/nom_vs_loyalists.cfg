"Nightmares of Meloen vs Loyalists" + "

" + "After having got a general purpose recruitment on turn 1, when realizing Nightmares of Meloen are facing Loyalists, they want to get <i>Scornful Watchers</i>. Their arcane focus special is using loyalists' arcane resistance at their detriment. The <i>Scornful Watcher</i> is rather fragile on melee though and you need to protect it at every time of day. The <i>Unhatched</i> is usually used for this job as it is quite cheap and thus does not divert too many resources from <i>Scornful Watcher</i> recruitment." + "

" + "While most of Loyalists' army is a threat to a wounded <i>Unhatched</i>, only the <i>Mage</i> will dare to attack them when their hitpoints are still high. If he fails to finish the <i>Unhatched</i>, a sacrifice on the <i>Mage</i> is a option to consider taking into account the huge difference in price and the massive damage the <i>Unhatched</i> can deal. When charging Loyalists' melee units, getting them cursed first will increase your chances to make damage, while support of the <i>Howling Darkness</i> will help reduce the retaliation." + "

" + "When retreating, the <i>Unhatched</i> must shield your other units so it is quite important they don't get hurt too bad at the end of the night. Consider with great care the possible moves of <i>Cavalrymen</i> as they will be the main tools to get you ZoC-ed when the day arrives. Recruit your <i>Unhatched</i> around second night so they are available to cover your retreat, recruit <i>Scornful Watcher</i> around second day so it can counterattack if Loyalists push too far." + "

" + "<u>Unhatched:</u> get enough of those to protect your weaker units. They can engage in combat with any ranged unit and melee unit too if you make full use of <i>Unhatched</i>'s trait. One exception might be the <i>Heavy Infantry</i>, which should not be attacked directly for fear of strong retaliation." + "

" + "<u>Black Cat:</u> get one or two of them to lower enemies' defense. Combined with the heavy-hitter <i>Unhatched</i> and <i>Scornful Watcher</i> they guarantee maximal damage. They can be use for village holding too if the number of attackers is limited." + "

" + "<u>Life Thief:</u> don't recruit those against Loyalists as their units all have good arcane resistance to counter its melee attack." + "

" + "<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> when facing Loyalists, it's showtime for the <i>Scornful Watcher</i>. You have to recruit enough of them to do plenty of damage at night but make sure you can cover them when the day comes. You should consider feeding them XP as the level 2's firepower is unmatched." + "

" + "<u>Howling Darkness:</u> you can recruit one of those to help the <i>Unhatched</i> clear the way for <i>Watchers</i> without taking too much punishment. Its own ranged attack can be of some help to weaken units that don't resist cold. Timing its attack is important because as soon as it strikes, you can't use its skirmisher for further support." + "

" + "<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> recruit some of them to ZoC-out your opponent's troops at dawn and trap them at dusk. When put in water they can restrain the mobility of <i>Mermen</i>, but should not engage in combat due to their poor resistance. The <i>Unstable Elemental</i> can also help holding the line when put on hill or forest. In the latter terrain, the slow special can keep the <i>Mages</i> away and their pierce resistance can hold the <i>Spearmen</i>." + "

" + "<u>Creeper:</u> you can use some of them to hurt <i>Mages</i>, <i>Bowmen</i> or horses. When your time of the day is over, you can also use them to shield more important units by forcing your opponent to use some unit to clear them out. Keep them in pack to lower upkeep." + "
