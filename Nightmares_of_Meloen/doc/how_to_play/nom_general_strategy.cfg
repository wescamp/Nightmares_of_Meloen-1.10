"General strategy for Nightmares of Meloen" + "

" + "Generally speaking, Nightmares of Meloen is a faction made of fast units that lack in resilience. In order to win, you have to keep your troops mobile and follow the day-night cycle. Some of Nightmares' units are relatively expensive which makes them unable to compete in number with most of Default's factions, but on the other hand they got a lot of abilities and specials that make them deadly when used right." + "

" + "They don't have a typical village holder and most of the time it's better to leave a village open than to sit on it waiting for your opponent's attack. If holding a village is of paramount importance, good candidates are the <i>Unhatched</i> and to a lesser extent the <i>Black Cat</i> or the <i>Scornful Watcher</i>, the former should be use to hold village threatened by melee oriented units while the latter two can hold against ranged units. Given it's poor resistance the <i>Black Cat</i> can't hold well against more than 2 units, so make sure to ZoC-out the other possible attackers. On hill and cave villages, the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> may be considered too." + "

" + "As Nightmares of Meloen are quite fast units, the village grabbing should not be a problem in the early game: <i>Unhatched</i>, <i>Black Cat</i>, <i>Unstable Elemental</i> and <i>Floating Darkness</i> all have 6 or more movement points. However as the last 3 units are rather weak and expensive, make sure you keep enough cash for buying units to protect them later. A typical first turn recruits could be: 2 <i>Unhatched</i>, 1 <i>Black Cat</i>, 1 <i>Unstable Elemental</i> and a mix of <i>Scornful Watcher</i>, <i>Life Thief</i>, <i>Howling Darkness</i> or additional <i>Unhatched</i>." + "

" + "<u>Unhatched:</u> for it's high resists and his low price, the <i>Unhatched</i> is the core unit of the Nightmares faction, filling both the big melee hitter and the cheap meatbag roles. It's good to have some for any of the possible Default era match-ups. While they are very efficient in taking damage in defense, they also have a major role in most offensive strategies. When attacking with them, mind the trait that gives them an edge against some damage types." + "

" + "<u>Black Cat:</u> The mage of Nightmares. It helps reduce the defender's defense when pushing an offensive, hence boosting every subsequently attacking unit's damage per cost ratio. While having strong defense overall, it deals little damage itself and suffers from poor resistance making it quite weak in one versus one combat." + "

" + "<u>Life Thief:</u> while it can be compared to the <i>Ghost</i> by some, it differs in its statistics. Though it has more HP and better attack than the <i>Ghost</i>, it has worse defense and resistance. Overall, this makes him less like a tank and more like an offensive weapon. This is particularly true against units with poor arcane resistance such as the drakes, trolls or woses. It can make an upset to a push of chaotic units with low defense too." + "

" + "<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> A unit closest to the archer role among the Nightmares faction, it's importance becomes high against any faction that has mostly good arcane resistance. As it turns any arcane resistance into a weakness, this Nightmares' unit is Loyalists' and Knalgans' nightmare, and could be put to good use against the arcane-neutral orcs. The <i>Scornful Watcher</i> is mostly a support ranged unit against both Drakes and Undead, but can be used to retaliate against the cold damage or poke at the saurians for the former or ghosts for the latter." + "

" + "<u>Howling Darkness:</u> a 7 movement point flying skirmisher with leadership is what we talk about. Lacking a melee attack and low in hitpoints, the <i>Howling Darkness</i> can't take care of itself. In exchange of their protection, other units will receive lower damage from opponent's attacks with the <i>Howling Darkness</i>. Keep in mind that to give that bonus, it must get next to the opponent's unit." + "

" + "<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> this is the game's most volatile unit. Most of its stats change according to the terrain it is standing on. With a very high movement point and a flyer movetype on its basic form, this can be used as Nightmares' scout. However be aware than in some of its variations, the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> trades most of its mobility for an increase in resistances." + "

" + "<u>Creepers:</u> a strategy changing unit. When all your attempts with <i>Unhatched</i> or <i>Life Thief</i> have failed, it's the time to bring the <i>Creepers</i> in. Low cost and low upkeep, you can amass them to block the opposition's advance. They have very high damage as long as you use the banding ability when attacking. If they can't win a game, they can save your day." + "
