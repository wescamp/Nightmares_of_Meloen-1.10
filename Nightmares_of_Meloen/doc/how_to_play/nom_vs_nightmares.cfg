_ "Nightmares of Meloen vs Nightmares" + "

" + _ "Like all mirror matches, this matchup requires that you use your units at their full potential to make a difference. The additional fun in this mirror is that you will make huge damages on every turn and that for most units the number of potential targets is pretty high." + "

" + _ "When realizing you face other Nightmares, get more <i>Life Thieves</i>. Beside other <i>Life Thieves</i>, its only real foe is the <i>Scornful Watcher</i>, so its life on the board is pretty easy. The only thing to worry about is getting slowed by a bramble form of the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> as that would make any <i>Scornful Watcher</i> around an immediate danger." + "

" + _ "Move onto the battlefield with <i>Life Thieves</i> going first. While you should not let them become slowed, you can lure some foe in the open to charge him with <i>Unhatched</i>. When moving, the <i>Unhatched</i> will be under constant pressure from opponent's <i>Life Thieves</i> so you should keep your <i>Scornful Watchers</i> in range to counter any attacks (bramble form of the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> can do as well)." + "

" + _ "In case you face a spam of bramble form of the <i>Unstable Elemental</i>, make sure you attack them one after the other, feeding the same <i>Life Thief</i> with kills. The bramble forms lack in attack power and even slowed <i>Life Thief</i> will heal enough on retaliation to survive. Putting your <i>Unhatched</i> on forest will deprive your opponent of the best spots and quickly force him to resign after your first <i>Life Thief</i> has levelled." + "

" + _ "<u>Unhatched:</u> while the damage the <i>Unhatched</i> can inflict is still pretty high against Nightmares, the impact damage he resists least is available to several units: <i>Unhatched</i>, <i>Scornful Watcher</i> and some forms of <i>Unstable Elemental</i> all have some and can inflict painful retaliation, which leaves the <i>Black Cat</i> and <i>Floating Darkness</i> as preferred targets. It is worth it though to throw the <i>Unhatched</i> on any <i>Scornful Watcher</i> around to protect your <i>Life Thief</i>." + "

" + _ "<u>Black Cat:</u> as most of Nightmares' units have pretty low defense, getting her is not mandatory, but if the opposition is seasoned, the increase in chance to hit will be welcome. In this case, the cat will be constantly endangered by the opposing <i>Unhatched</i>. As the jinx special does not affect units of nightmare race (<i>Life Thief</i>, <i>Floating Darkness</i>), it will be best used on <i>Unhatched</i> as they won't retaliate. Also, Cursing an <i>Unstable Elemental</i> can help your <i>Life Thief</i> heal faster." + "

" + _ "<u>Life Thief:</u> its arcane attacks spread panic and desolation among the ranks of opposing Nightmares. It badly hurts any unit around, getting healed in the process except against units of nightmare race. Definitely get some." + "

" + _ "<u>Scornful Watcher:</u> When it comes to taming the <i>Life Thief</i>, no other unit can do the job better and safer than the Watcher. Being a major threat to the powerful <i>Life Thief</i>, along with the <i>Life Thief</i> itself, it will be closely followed by the opponent's <i>Unhatched</i> and should hence be protected by yours. If no better attack opportunity presents itself, taking on the <i>Creepers</i> never hurts." + "

" + _ "<u>Howling Darkness:</u> the <i>Howling Darkness</i> helps reduce the impact of retaliation, saving a couple of health points that can turn death into life. However, due to its high price and lack of resilience, one of them is enough. Its cold ranged should be left for the <i>Unhatched</i>, which has no resistance against it." + "

" + _ "<u>Unstable Elemental:</u> in its basic tornado form, it is quite weak, and taking into account how fast the <i>Unhatched</i> is, it might be hard to keep it alive. Move it to a forest or hill and it will trade its blade for an impact attack that will earn <i>Unhatched</i>'s respect. The bramble form gets a slow special on its ranged attack that comes in handy against the <i>Life Thief</i>. This asset will make it the reigning form on the battlefield as the quake form's comparatively higher blade and fire resistance won't have any use. " + "

" + _ "<u>Creeper:</u> while not playing a significant role in the mirror matchup, the <i>Creepers</i> can always bring a change in strategy. Their main targets would then be the <i>Watchers</i>, the <i>Floating Darkness</i> and the <i>Black Cats</i>." + "
