"Northerners vs Nightmares of Meloen" + "

" + "Both factions do have tremendous melee heavy hitters: the cheap <i>Unhatched</i> and the cheaper <i>Orcish Grunt</i>. Relying on them to make a breakthrough is quite a gamble and the best way to keep in control of the game is more than often making the best use of the ranged fighters, the <i>Scornful Watcher</i> for one side, the <i>Orcish Archer</i> for the other. Due to the threat they represent, they will be the focus of the melee unit tactics." + "

" + "Another similarity between these two factions is how the <i>Black Cat</i> and the <i>Orcish Assassin</i> are used. Both unit bypass the defense to hit the target and disrupt it until it has healed on a village. As both factions, don't have a healer, the villages is an important asset and should be kept at all time. Your <i>Orcish Assassin</i> does only impact a couple of Nightmares' units so you should keep them in low number." + "

" + "Northerners make better use of terrain to improve their defense, so push Nightmares to fight you on patches of good terrain. Keep in mind to always put in front the units with more hitpoints in order to make maximum retaliation and give you the opportunity to kill on your turn. They also have more diverse damage type available and can more easily press, choosing where to attack depending on <i>Unhatched</i>'s trait." + "

" + "<u>Goblin Spearman:</u> evidence that the little one from the Orcish family play an essential role has still to be found. But you can still get a couple of <i>Goblin Spearmen</i> in some circumstances. They can be helpful at taking down the ranged oriented <i>Black Cats</i> and <i>Scornful Watchers</i>, can hold a village quite well when facing a single <i>Unhatched</i> and can give a hand at disinfecting an area from <i>Creepers</i>." + "

" + "<u>Naga Fighter:</u> when a patch of water is available, recruiting a <i>Naga Fighter</i> may be required. While his range is very similar to the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> due to his decent movetype on land, he cannot fight as well as the <i>Merman Fighter</i> against them." + "

" + "<u>Orcish Archer:</u> he is Northerners' best weapon against <i>Life Thieves</i> with their low defense everywhere and, for this reason, will attract <i>Unhatched</i> as if he was a mage. The other special of the <i>Orcish Archer</i> is that he will be the only unit to make equal damage to any <i>Unhatched</i> regardless of his trait, so you can always use him on the <i>Unhatched</i> that resists best the damage type you have recruited. You have to protect him though and leveling one is a big achievement for this matchup." + "

" + "<u>Orcish Assassin:</u> the <i>Orcish Assassin</i> while not being able to kill much in this matchup, remains useful. You can have one on the board at any time. Aberrations and <i>Unstable Elementals</i> only can be poisoned, the ones that give the hardest time to Northerners can be: <i>Unhatched</i>, <i>Black Cat</i> and <i>Scornful Watcher</i>. Poisoning <i>Unhatcheds</i> is particularly efficient as they possibly get a lot of damage in retaliation if they keep attacking so Nightmares do not want them to be low on HP. When the opportunity shows, poisoning the <i>Unstable Elemental</i> is neat too." + "

" + "<u>Orcish Grunt:</u> the loyal <i>Grunt</i> proves himself again one of the best units in this matchup. Being able to do heavy retaliation on both <i>Unhatched</i> and <i>Life Thief</i>, he is in charge of clearing <i>Black Cats</i> and <i>Scornful Watchers</i> from the map. When all the possible targets have been decimated, you can use him to protect your <i>Orcish Archers</i> from <i>Unhatched</i> or your <i>Troll Whelp</i> from <i>Life Thieves</i>. It can also be used to give the killing blow to a <i>Life Thief</i>, if you don't have more archers available." + "

" + "<u>Troll Whelp:</u> he is the solution when the board starts looking like an egg incubator. His impact damage and regeneration, combined with his low price makes any <i>Unhatched</i> spam a complete failure. The <i>Life Thieves</i> like to use his arcane weakness to drain him, thus being able to hold armies of <i>Troll Whelps</i>, so you should only recruit them when the number of <i>Unhatched</i> requires them. The <i>Troll Whelp</i>'s regeneration does not cure the effect of the <i>Black Cat</i>'s jinx, so, if cursed, his defense will drop to a critically low level." + "

" + "<u>Wolf Rider:</u> with his exceptional movement and his three strike attack, the <i>Wolf Rider</i> can have a use against Nightmares depending on your play style. He can track down wounded or poisoned units when they flee, he can also keep in range of <i>Howling Darkness</i> for free hitting. Generally speaking, his movetype allows you to dispatch him wherever you need one hit or two without using one of your heavy hitters." + "

" + "<u>Summary:</u>" + "
" + "There are two strategies to fight Nightmares with Northerners." + "
" + "The first one is to rely on <i>Troll Whelps</i> to control the <i>Unhatched</i>. As a consequence, Nightmares will recruit <i>Life Thieves</i> to heal on them while inflicting enough damage with <i>Troll Whelp</i>'s arcane weakness and his low defense. On your side, you will recruit <i>Orcish Archers</i> to beat the <i>Life Thieves</i> down. You still have to recruit some <i>Orcish Grunts</i> as he is still the best unit to hold strategic places against the <i>Life Thief</i>." + "
" + "The second path you can go is to go for a maximum of <i>Orcish Grunts</i>. If so, be ready to see <i>Black Cats</i> and <i>Scornful Watchers</i> coming in to take at them. They will be covered by <i>Unhatcheds</i> that you will target with some <i>Orcish Assassin</i> to disrupt his organization, and still some <i>Orcish Archers</i>. As poison will be often used and you will face ranged units, the <i>Wolf Rider</i> can bring additional tactics that can help getting a kill or extend the effect of poison on a trapped unit." + "
